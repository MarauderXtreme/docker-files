## About

From: http://devnull-as-a-service.com/
> In modern days everything is a service. You create documents, upload photos, deploy computers, but what's happening to your trash? That's why we're launching /dev/null to the cloud.
>
> IAAS, SAAS, PAAS, holy fuckshit, we call our baby DAAS.
>
> Don't get rid of your data yourself anymore. Use our distributed service located in over 380 countries! No matter if you're using it personally or for your business: plans for whole companies are available as well.
>
> Just because, of course, everything should be a managed-service somewhere in the internet!
